# Experiment 6
## Transforms (Walsh, Hadamard, DCT, Haar). 

### Algorithm
1. Walsh Transform
o Compute the Walsh matrix using Hadamard matrices.
o Multiply the input vector with the Walsh matrix.
2. Hadamard Transform
o Compute the Hadamard matrix of the required order.
o Multiply the input vector with the Hadamard matrix.
3. Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
o Compute the DCT coefficients using the standard formula.
o Use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for an efficient computation.
4. Haar Transform
o Apply Haar wavelet decomposition iteratively.
o Compute the average and difference between adjacent elements to form a new transformed vector.
